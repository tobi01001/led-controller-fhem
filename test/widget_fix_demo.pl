print "=== FHEM Widget Override Fix Demonstration ===\n\n";

print "ISSUE RESOLVED: Wrong use of widget Override\n";
print "https://github.com/tobi01001/led-controller-fhem/issues/10\n\n";

print "PROBLEM:\n";
print "- Module was using widgetOverride attributes (meant for end-users)\n";
print "- Select dropdowns had incorrect format missing value indices\n";
print "- Whitespace in option names was not properly handled\n";
print "- Reading values not correctly shown as labels in UI\n\n";

print "SOLUTION:\n";
print "- Widgets now attached directly to commands in Set function help\n";
print "- Select dropdowns use proper value,label format (e.g., 0,Static,1,Rainbow)\n";
print "- Options with spaces are properly quoted (e.g., 0,\"Option One\")\n";
print "- Ensures actual reading shows label name even when transmitted as index\n\n";

print "BEFORE (problematic formats):\n";
print "  effect:selectnumbers,Static,Rainbow,Fire  # Missing value indices\n";
print "  mode:selectnumbers,Simple Mode,Advanced   # Spaces break parsing\n\n";

print "AFTER (correct formats):\n";
print "  effect:selectnumbers,0,Static,1,Rainbow,2,Fire\n";
print "  mode:selectnumbers,0,\"Simple Mode\",1,Advanced\n\n";

print "=== Simulated Set Function Help Output ===\n\n";

# Simulate the fixed Set function help
my @commands = (
    "refresh",
    "auto_play:uzsuToggle,off,on",
    "brightness:slider,0,1,255",
    "effect:selectnumbers,0,Static,1,\"Rainbow Effect\",2,Fire,3,\"Custom Mode\"",
    "solid_color:colorpicker",
    "speed:slider,1,1,100",
    "on",
    "off"
);

print "set myLED ?\n";
print "Unknown argument ?, choose one of " . join(" ", @commands) . "\n\n";

print "KEY IMPROVEMENTS:\n";
print "✓ No widgetOverride attributes used (correct FHEM practice)\n";
print "✓ Widgets attached directly to commands\n";
print "✓ Select dropdowns include value,label mapping\n";
print "✓ Whitespace in labels properly quoted\n";
print "✓ Dynamic generation returned to fhemWeb correctly\n";
print "✓ Reading values display as labels in UI\n\n";

print "TECHNICAL DETAILS:\n";
print "- LEDController_BuildCommandWidget() generates proper format\n";
print "- LEDController_BuildWebCmd() also fixed for consistency\n";
print "- Both functions handle whitespace quoting correctly\n";
print "- Comprehensive tests added for validation\n\n";

print "FILES MODIFIED:\n";
print "- FHEM/98_LEDController.pm: Fixed selectnumbers format and whitespace handling\n";
print "- test/widget_format_test.pl: New comprehensive widget format tests\n";
print "- test/whitespace_handling_test.pl: New whitespace handling tests\n";
print "- test/fhem_controls_test.pl: Updated to reflect new approach\n\n";
